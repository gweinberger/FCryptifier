## 2. How can I contribute?
Contributing is simple. Here's how you can do it:

2. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the fork button in the top right corner.
3. **Clone the Repository**: After forking, clone the repo to your local machine to make changes.
5. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, switch to a new branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
    ```
6. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature or fix.
7. **Run Tests**: Ensure your changes do not break any existing functionality.
8. **Write Commit Messages**: Follow the [Conventional Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
9. **Push to GitHub**: After committing your changes, push them to GitHub:
    ```
